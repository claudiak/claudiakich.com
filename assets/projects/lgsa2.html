			I was hired to coordinate the hiring of companies providing online solutions, negotiate terms and values as well as monitoring the quality and timeline.
			<br><br>One of the projects was the annual portal called Cultural Awards, which contained a content management system builded with Ruby on Rails, where local artists could post photos and videos of their works to be voted.
			<br><br>The company that was doing this project asked me AUD 16,000 and three months to make the changes necessary for that year.
			<br><br>My first great achievement was sucessfully change the layout and the parameters of candidatures dates, votes and publication of results, in only 15 days.
