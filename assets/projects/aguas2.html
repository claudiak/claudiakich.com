			I was hired as a Sr Web Designer to create the layout of Aguas Claras Shopping Investors. The challenge was to implement a layout respecting the best practices of UI / UX and implement a CMS - Wordpress - which allows them to do the maintenance independently.

			After getting the requirements with the Institution and approve the new information architecture, I implemented the system, tested and trained the marketing team to use the CMS through workshops and video tutorials.
