		As an expert Web Designer and Master the challenge was to automate manual processes and the publication of information and documents.
		<br><br>
		In addition to implementing portal with Joomla content management system, used to disseminate information aimed at the exchange of knowledge and experiences in areas of mutual interest between Brazil and the European Union, I had also developed a system for management of Reference Terms, including management of professionals travels, meetings and conferences - processes manually made using forms.		
Após concluídos os dois sistemas (portal e gerenciamento de termos de referência), foram feitos workshops, treinamentos, manuais e video-tutoriais para os servidores.
