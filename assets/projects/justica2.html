			I was hired as a Sr Web Designer to create the new portal layout of the Ministry of Justice. The challenge was to implement a new layout respecting the best practices of UI / UX and accessibility taking advantage of the content management system currently used by them - Lumis Portal.
			<br><br>
			I chose to implement the framework Bootstrap 3.0 and found some challenges to integrate it with the Lumis, via XML.
			<br><br>
			After getting the requirements with the Institution and approve the new information architecture, I implemented and tested the Bootstrap and trained a team of junior and mid-level designers to effect maintenance through workshops and video tutorials.
